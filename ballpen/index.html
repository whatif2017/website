        <h3>Ink your way</h3>
        <p>Now more than ever, in a technological era held by smartphones, digital and electronic screens, all of which made handwriting at and impersonal, the pen is a tool that most recalls the human being. A tool which has followed along mankind from generation to generation, giving certainty to whoever used it, because of its indelible sign. </p>
        <p>The pen is a powerful device for communication, an object capable of making a permanent trail of itself. Scriball exists with the purpose of giving back dignity to handwriting and wants to be a synonym of independence and liberty of expression; a tool that can leave a mark of its own identity. Its main feature is the powerful expression of said mark as a symbol of simplicity, made of perfect analogic elements. Attention is set upon a ball pen which, other than doing its regular jobs like drawing and writing, can become a fun and engaging tool, which aims for irony and having fun. </p>
        <p>Scriball sets its own mood as naive, happy and vivacious and aims to engage people who can immerse themselves in the universe of the ball pen and freely experiment new solutions. </p>
